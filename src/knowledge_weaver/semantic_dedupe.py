"""Second-pass semantic dedup over EXISTING entities.

Ingest-time resolution (resolver.py) only compares a *freshly extracted* entity
against the DB. It never re-compares two entities that were both created in the
same batch — e.g. a historical rebuild where the LLM phrased the same concept
slightly differently per file (``聚合逻辑集成到HomeBrain`` vs ``…自身不依赖外部脚本``).
Those become distinct ids that never merge, so cross-file accumulation
(day_count / files / importance) silently breaks (real-data finding 2026-06-04:
only 1/262 entities were multi-file).

This pass walks the whole DB, finds same-type vector-similar pairs, and:
  - cosine >= HIGH  -> auto-merge (survivor = higher day_count, accumulating it)
  - MID <= cosine < HIGH -> queue to merge_review (human decides)
  - identifier-like names -> review only, never auto (bge-m3 over-similarity)

Reuses the resolver's bands + identifier guard so behaviour matches ingest-time.
Merges accumulate day_count, which is exactly the signal the rebuild flattened.
