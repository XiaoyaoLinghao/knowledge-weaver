"""W3.4: schema for typed knowledge-graph relations.

KW's relations are currently generic ``RELATES_TO`` (co-occurrence within a
file). This module defines a small CLOSED relation vocabulary so an LLM can
re-type each candidate edge into a meaningful, directed relation — or abstain
(``none``) to prune spurious co-occurrence edges. Closed vocab is essential:
unconstrained extraction yields thousands of relation types (Neo4j finding).

Entity types (KW): project / preference / decision / fact / risk / task / tech / idea.
